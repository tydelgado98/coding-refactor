## Description

- My motivation in this repo was giving old code a new life.
- Ive built this project to show that you can make coding a lot less cluttered and make it look more easy to read.
- This covers some of the things you can do with just semantics.
- With this I have learned the basics of semantics and how to properly place them in the HTML.
